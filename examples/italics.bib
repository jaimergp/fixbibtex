	Abstract = {The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a versatile molecular weapon used by many bacteria against eukaryotic hosts or prokaryotic competitors. It consists of a cytoplasmic bacteriophage tail-like structure anchored in the bacterial cell envelope via a cytoplasmic baseplate and a periplasmic membrane complex. Rapid contraction of the sheath in the bacteriophage tail-like structure propels an inner tube/spike complex through the target cell envelope to deliver effectors. While structures of purified contracted sheath and purified membrane complex have been solved, because sheaths contract upon cell lysis and purification, no structure is available for the extended sheath. Structural information about the baseplate is also lacking. Here, we use electron cryotomography to directly visualize intact T6SS structures inside Myxococcus xanthus cells. Using sub-tomogram averaging, we resolve the structure of the extended sheath and membrane-associated components including the baseplate. Moreover, we identify novel extracellular bacteriophage tail fiber-like antennae. These results provide new structural insights into how the extended sheath prevents premature disassembly and how this sophisticated machine may recognize targets.},

@article{Shikuma2016,
	Abstract = {Free-swimming larvae of many animals that inhabit the sea floor metamorphose in response to bacteria. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin animal metamorphosis in response to bacterial triggers remain elusive. We investigated the developmental cascade induced by bacteria in a model tubeworm, Hydroides elegans, and identified a bacterial mutant and host signaling system critical for the initiation of and tissue remodeling during metamorphic development, respectively. Identifying the triggers for metamorphosis in Hydroides has implications for understanding basic principles of bacteria--animal interactions. Such interactions are also major causes of biofouling, which our research indicates may be controlled by manipulating bacterial inducers or MAPK activities that are essential for tubeworm metamorphosis.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n@ShikumaLab$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMetamorphosis in response to ... bacteria! $\backslash$r$\backslash$nCheck out our new paper},

@article{Sergeant2003,
	Abstract = {Four genes on a genomic fragment from Xenorhabdus nematophilus PMFI296 were shown to be involved in insecticidal activity towards three commercially important insect species. Each gene was expressed individually and in combinations in Escherichia coli, and the insecticidal activity of the lysates was determined. The combined four genes (xptA1, xptA2, xptB1, and xptC1), in E. coli, showed activity towards Pieris brassicae, Pieris rapae, and Heliothis virescens. The genes xptA1, xptB1, and xptC1 were involved in expressing activity towards P. rapae and P. brassicae, while the genes xptA2, xptB1, and xptC1 were needed for activity towards H. virescens. When each of these three genes was expressed individually in E. coli and the cell lysates were used in insect assays or mixed and then used, insecticidal activity was detected at a very low level. If the genes xptB1 and xptC1 were expressed in the same E. coli cell and this cell lysate was mixed with cells expressing xptA1, activity was restored to P. rapae and P. brassicae. Similarly mixing XptB1/C1 lysate with XptA2 lysate restored activity towards H. virescens. Individual gene disruptions in X. nematophilus PMFI296 reduced activity to insects; this activity was restored by complementation with cells expressing either xptA1 or xptA2 for their respective disruptions or E. coli expressing both xptB1 and xptC1 for individual disruptions of either of these genes. The genes xptA2, xptC1, and xptB1 were expressed as an operon in PMFI296 and inactivation of xptA2 or xptC1 resulted in silencing of downstream gene(s), while xptA1 was expressed as a single gene. Therefore, the two three gene product combinations interact with each other to produce good insecticidal activity.},
