These are compared to the NEXAFS spectra of multilayers and monolayers of C4H8, C5H8, C6H12, and C8H8 on Pt(111). Multiple scattering X$\alpha$ calculations of the spectra of cyclopropane, cyclobutane, and cyclohexane are also reported. In most cases the gas and solid spectra are essentially the same indicating that intramolecular transitions dominate in the condensed phase. The NEXAFS polarization dependence of the condensed phases has assisted spectral assignments and the determination of the molecular orientation in the monolayer phase. In the saturated species a sharp feature about 3 eV below the carbon 1s ionization threshold is identified as a transition to a state of mixed Rydberg/valence character with the $\pi$∗(CH2) valence component dominating. Except for cyclopropane the positions of the main $\sigma$ ∗ resonances correlate with the C–C bond lengths in a manner similar to that reported previously for noncyclic aliphatic molecules. In the spectra of monolayer C6H12, C5H8, and C8H8 spectral broadening and weak additional features are observed which are attributed to molecule–surface interactions.},

Dynamic localization of PleD to the cell pole provides a mechanism to temporally and spatially control the signaling output of PleD during development. Targeting of PleD to the cell pole is coupled to the activation of a C-terminal guanylate cyclase domain, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate.

@article{Dietrich2018,
	abstract = {Mammalian orthoreovirus attachment to target cells is mediated by the outer capsid protein $\sigma$1, which projects from the virion surface. The $\sigma$1 protein is a homotrimer consisting of a filamentous tail, which is partly inserted into the virion; a body domain constructed from $\beta$-spiral repeats; and a globular head with receptor-binding properties. The $\sigma$1 tail is predicted to form an $\alpha$-helical coiled coil. Although $\sigma$1 undergoes a conformational change during cell entry, the nature of this change and its contributions to viral replication are unknown. Electron micrographs of $\sigma$1 molecules released from virions identified three regions of flexibility, including one at the midpoint of the molecule, that may be involved in its structural rearrangement. To enable a detailed understanding of essential $\sigma$1 tail organization and properties, we determined high-resolution structures of the reovirus type 1 Lang (T1L) and type 3 Dearing (T3D) $\sigma$1 tail domains. Both molecules feature extended $\alpha$-helical coiled coils, with T1L $\sigma$1 harboring central chloride ions. Each molecule displays a discontinuity (stutter) within the coiled coil and an unexpectedly seamless transition to the body domain. The transition region features conserved interdomain interactions and appears rigid rather than highly flexible. Functional analyses of reoviruses containing engineered $\sigma$1 mutations suggest that conserved residues predicted to stabilize the coiled-coil-to-body junction are essential for $\sigma$1 folding and encapsidation, whereas central chloride ion coordination and the stutter are dispensable for efficient replication. Together, these findings enable modeling of full-length reovirus $\sigma$1 and provide insight into the stabilization of a multidomain virus attachment protein.},
