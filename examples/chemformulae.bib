@article{Hitchcock1986,
	abstract = {The carbon K‐shell excitation spectra of gaseous cyclic hydrocarbons, both saturated (cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane) and unsaturated (cyclopentene, cyclohexene, and cyclooctatetraene), have been recorded by electron energy loss spectroscopy under dipole‐dominated conditions. These are compared to the NEXAFS spectra of multilayers and monolayers of C4H8, C5H8, C6H12, and C8H8 on Pt(111). Multiple scattering X$\alpha$ calculations of the spectra of cyclopropane, cyclobutane, and cyclohexane are also reported. In most cases the gas and solid spectra are essentially the same indicating that intramolecular transitions dominate in the condensed phase. The NEXAFS polarization dependence of the condensed phases has assisted spectral assignments and the determination of the molecular orientation in the monolayer phase. In the saturated species a sharp feature about 3 eV below the carbon 1s ionization threshold is identified as a transition to a state of mixed Rydberg/valence character with the $\pi$∗(CH2) valence component dominating. Except for cyclopropane the positions of the main $\sigma$ ∗ resonances correlate with the C–C bond lengths in a manner similar to that reported previously for noncyclic aliphatic molecules. In the spectra of monolayer C6H12, C5H8, and C8H8 spectral broadening and weak additional features are observed which are attributed to molecule–surface interactions.},

@article{Lee1985,
	abstract = {The title molecular anions have been studied at the self‐consistent‐field (SCF) level of theory with several different basis sets. The smallest of these bases is triple zeta (TZ) in quality while the largest can be labeled near Hartree–Fock limit. The dependence of proton affinities, dipole moments, harmonic frequencies, and infrared intensities on the inclusion of diffuse functions in the basis set is investigated. It is concluded that at the SCF level of theory the addition of diffuse s and p functions (for first row elements) is necessary in order to obtain reliable results. This is true especially for NH− 2 and CH− 3. A method to extend any standard Gaussian basis set is suggested. Finally, predictions are made for some of the as yet unobserved fundamentals of the anions.},

@article{Yamada1981,
	abstract = {The v 2 = 1←0, 2←1, and 3←2 bands of the methyl radical were observed in the gas phase by infrared tunable diode laser spectroscopy at 606.4531, 681.6369, and 731.0757 cm−1. The observed vibration–rotation spectra were analyzed to derive precise values for the rotational constants, centrifugal distortion constants, and spin–rotation interaction constants. The absence of N = odd, K = 0 levels in the v 2 = even states and of N = even, K = 0 levels in the v 2 = odd states was confirmed, indicating that each vibrational state is nondegenerate. The observed band origins, when analyzed, led to a potential function for the out‐of‐plane bending vibration that has no potential hump at the planar configuration. The large negative anharmonicity of this potential was ascribed to a vibronic interaction with excited electronic states. The methyl radical was generated by a 60 Hz discharge in di‐t e r t‐butyl peroxide and was found to have a lifetime of about 1.4 msec; its concentration in the absorption cell was estimated to be about 1013 molecules/cm3, provided that a recombination reaction is the only route for eliminating methyl radicals.},

@article{Werner1981,
	abstract = {Potential energy, dipole moment, and transition moment functions have been calculated for the two lowest II + states of LiF using MCSCF wave functions. By optimizing both states simultaneously with a particular choice of configurations it is possible to account for the major part of the correlation energy difference of the neutral and ionic states and to obtain the correct separation of the states at infinite internuclear distance. A simple method to obtain a diabatic description of the two states is proposed. In the crossing region nonadiabatic coupling elements have been calculated},
